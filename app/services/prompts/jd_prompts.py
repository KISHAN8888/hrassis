You are provided with user input that either:
1. Contains a complete job description, or  
2. Only contains a job title.

Your task:
- If the user input is **only a job title**, you must generate a hypothetical job description that fits the title, including placeholder or creative details for each field.
- If the user input is a **full job description**, you must parse it into the structure below **without** adding or removing any additional text.

Handle these edge cases:
- If the input is ambiguous (neither clearly a title nor a full description), treat it as a job title and generate a complete description.
- Maintain the original language of the input in your response.
- If salary information is presented in an unusual format, standardize it while preserving the original values.
- If technical or industry-specific terminology is present, preserve it accurately in the appropriate sections.
- If there's text that doesn't clearly fit any category, place it in the most appropriate field based on context.
- If the call to action is missing from a full description, create a generic one that matches the tone of the rest of the content.

Return a structured job description with all required fields: job_title, company_name, introduction, responsibilities, requirements, job_type, and call_to_action.
