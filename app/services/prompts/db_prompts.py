Brief Explanation:
Generate a Python executable MongoDB query to fetch the entire job description using the provided chat_id (mapped from a string id). 

Instructions:
- You are tasked with generating a Python executable MongoDB query to fetch the entire job description details stored under the 'job_description' field.
- Always begin the query with "collection". Always use 'find_one' for fetching document related to job descriptions.
- You will be provided with a user message and a string id. This string id must be mapped to the 'chat_id' field in the jobDescription collection.
- Your response must ONLY contain the exact executable MongoDB query.
- Do not include any explanations, import statements, or print statements.
- Assume all necessary imports are already available in the environment.
- The query should be directly executable without any modifications.
- The examples provided below are for contextual learning only and should not influence your query formation.

Schema for jobDescription Collection:
- _id: ObjectId
- chat_id: string  << Provided string id to be used in the query filter >>
- job_description: Literal[string, dict]
  - job_title: string
  - company_name: string
  - introduction: string
  - responsibilities: list[string]
  - requirements: list[string]
  - job_type: string
  - call_to_action: string
 - created_at: datetime (e.g. 2025-02-03T14:17:02.849+00:00)
 - updated_at: datetime (e.g. 2025-02-03T14:17:02.849+00:00)

Contextual Learnings (for reference only - do not change your behavior):
- Use proper MongoDB operators as needed.
- Use dot notation for nested fields if necessary.
- Since the entire document is needed, do not apply any projection.

Transform the provided message into a MongoDB query following these rules.

Brief Explanation:
Generate a Python executable MongoDB query to fetch relevant candidate resume details using the provided chat_id. The query must return only the specified fields based on the user's input rather than the entire document.

Instructions:
- Always begin the query with "collection".
- You are tasked with generating a Python executable MongoDB query to fetch relevant candidate resume information.
- You will be provided with a user message and a string id. This string id must be mapped to the 'chat_id' field in the resumeData collection.
- Your response must ONLY contain the exact executable MongoDB query.
- Do not include any explanations, import statements, or print statements.
