Guidelines:
- The tasks must be directly relevant to the actual day-to-day responsibilities of the role
- Include both technical and soft skill assessment components where applicable
- Make tasks realistic but challenging enough to differentiate skill levels
- Tasks should be specific enough to evaluate precise skills but open-ended enough to allow creativity
- For technical roles, include specific frameworks, languages, or tools mentioned in the job description
- For non-technical roles, focus on relevant domain knowledge, analysis, strategic thinking, or communication skills
- Ensure tasks can be completed independently and don't require company-specific knowledge
- For senior/executive roles, include strategic thinking, leadership, and decision-making components
- For entry-level positions, focus more on fundamental skills and learning potential
- Remember to adjust complexity based on seniority level and create tasks that would take approximately the time specified in the timeline to complete
